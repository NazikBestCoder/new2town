# new2town
## Description
- To showcase our skills with creating a fullstack application we developed New2Town.
- New2Town is a functional yet simple social media app focused one finding new people to be friends with in your area (Note: this is not a dating app).
- If you have recently moved to a new area sometimes it can be hard to make local friends. New2Town is an app dedicated to finding people who can help you explore your new home.
- We learned a lot about the MVC framework and how to use routes to manage a mysql database.
